  <p>Astronomy (from Ancient Greek ἀστρονομία (astronomía) 'science that studies the laws of the stars') is a natural
    science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. It uses mathematics, physics, and chemistry in order to
    explain their origin and evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, nebulae, galaxies, and
    comets. Relevant phenomena include supernova explosions, gamma ray bursts, quasars, blazars, pulsars, and cosmic
    microwave background radiation. More generally, astronomy studies everything that originates beyond Earth's
    atmosphere. Cosmology is a branch of astronomy that studies the universe as a whole.[1]

    Astronomy is one of the oldest natural sciences. The early civilizations in recorded history made methodical
    observations of the night sky. These include the Babylonians, Greeks, Indians, Egyptians, Chinese, Maya, and many
    ancient indigenous peoples of the Americas. In the past, astronomy included disciplines as diverse as astrometry,
    celestial navigation, observational astronomy, and the making of calendars. Nowadays, professional astronomy is
    often said to be the same as astrophysics.[2]

    Professional astronomy is split into observational and theoretical branches. Observational astronomy is focused on
    acquiring data from observations of astronomical objects. This data is then analyzed using basic principles of
    physics. Theoretical astronomy is oriented toward the development of computer or analytical models to describe
    astronomical objects and phenomena. These two fields complement each other. Theoretical astronomy seeks to explain
    observational results and observations are used to confirm theoretical results.</p>
